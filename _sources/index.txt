Energy Perforamnce Certificate toolkit - EPCTK
==============================================

Introduction
------------


This project aims to be a free and open source implementation of
the UK Energy Performance Certificate and underlying RdSAP and SAP
models.

It is written in Python (version 3.4 +) for easy integration with other
data processing code, with the aim of enabling a variety of workflows.
Particular attention will be given enabling highly automated workflows
with large datasets. To acheive this goal a number of features are required
(which are currently at various stages of completion)

- Implementation of SAP and RdSAP models
- Implementation of model-based EPC outputs
- Standardised data input with well defined input schema
- Adapter code for common data sources
- Reusable, documented and unit-tested code
