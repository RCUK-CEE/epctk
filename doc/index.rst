UK Energy Performance Certificate toolkit - EPCTK
=================================================

Introduction
------------


This project aims to be a free and open source implementation of
the UK Energy Performance Certificate and underlying RdSAP and SAP
models.

The target spec implementation is currently SAP 2009, with the intention
of adding newer versions in the future.

It is written in Python (version 3.4 +) for easy integration with other
data processing code, with the aim of enabling a variety of workflows.
Particular attention will be given enabling highly automated workflows
with large datasets. To acheive this goal a number of features are required
(which are currently at various stages of completion)

- Implementation of SAP and RdSAP models
- Implementation of model-based EPC outputs
- Standardised data input with well defined input schema
- Adapter code for common data sources
- Reusable, documented and unit-tested code


Motivation
----------

Currently available EPC/RdSAP/SAP are both proprietary and not
well suited for inclusion in highly automated workflows. This
project provides code that is auditable and readily improved,
and easily integrated into other python codebases.
