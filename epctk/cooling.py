    Part 10 SPACE COOLING REQUIREMENT

    The space cooling requirement should always be calculated (section 8c of the worksheet).
    It is included in the DER and ratings if the dwelling has a fixed air conditioning system.
    This is based on standardised cooling patterns of 6 hours/day operation and cooling of part
    of or all the dwelling to 24Â°C. Details are given in Tables 10, 10a and 10b and the associated equations.
