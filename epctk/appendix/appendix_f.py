Electric CPSUs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An electric CPSU is a central heating system providing space and domestic water heating.
Primary water heated mainly during low-rate periods to up to 95Â°C in winter is stored
in a thermal store. If the CPSU volume is less than 270 litres, the resulting high-rate
fraction can lead to a poor SAP rating.

The procedure in this appendix applies for a 10-hour off-peak tariff providing 3 low-rate
periods per day. It is not valid for other tariffs.
