PCDF Files encoding
-------------------

The PCDF files as downloaded from the BRE site have a non-standard text encoding which
doesn't work nicely with the python data import. They must therefore be re-saved with
correct UTF8 encoding. This can be done by opening the file in a plain-text editor such
as SublimeText and using 'save with encoding' set to UTF8.
