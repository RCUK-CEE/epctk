The UK EPC Toolkit: epctk
=========================

This project aims to be a free and open source implementation of
the UK Energy Performance Certificate and underlying RdSAP and SAP
models.

It is written in Python for easy integration with other data processing
code, with the aim of enabling a variety of workflows. Particular
attention will be given enabling highly automated workflows with large
datasets. To acheive this goal a number of features are required
(which are currently at various stages of completion)

- Implementation of SAP and RdSAP models
- Implementation of model-based EPC outputs
- Standardised data input with well defined input schema
- Adapter code for common data sources
- Reusable, documented and unit-tested code
